# Student-Management-System-
Worked on a team-based project to maintain and improve a Student Management System as part of the Software Maintenance and Configuration course. The project followed a phased approach to analyze, enhance, and document the system. This experience strengthened my skills in software maintenance, system analysis, and collaborative teamwork.
